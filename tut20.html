      In this article, we will know HTML Entities, along with understanding
      their implementation through the examples. HTML provides some method to
      display reserved characters. Reserved characters are those characters that
      are either reserved for HTML or those which are not present in the basic
      keyboard. For instance, ‘<‘ is reserved in HTML language. Sometimes this
      character needs to display on the web page which creates ambiguity in
      code. Along with these are the characters which are normally not present
      in basic keyboard ( £, ¥, €, © ), etc. HTML provides some Entity names and
      Entity numbers to use these symbols. Entity names are case-sensitive.
      Entity number is easy to learn.
