    <title> Color Styles and HSL</title>
</head>
<body>
    There are three types of color 
    1. Hexadecimal styles we define the color in 6 digit hexadecimal number (frm 0 yo F ) .  It is denotaed by #. THe first two digits indicater Red color , next two Green color , and the last two blue color . 

    <p>if we want all H1 tags of purple color </p>
    <!-- 
        h1 {
            color: #00ff00
        }
     -->

     RGB{Red, Green Blue} In this we need to give 3 numbers indicating the amount of red, green and blue colors respectively required in the mixed color. The range of each color is from 0 to 255. 

     <!-- Example: If we want all ‘h1’ tags of green color. 
        h1 {
            color:rgb(0, 255, 0);
        }
    -->

    <address>Note :rgba(0,0,0) is black and rgb(255,255,255) is white color.</address>

    <!-- 
        RGBA Style [Red Green Blue Alpha] : This style allows us to make the color transparent according to our will. Alpha indicates the degree of transparency. The range of green, blue and red is from 0 to 255 and that of alpha is from 0 to 1.

            Example: If we want all ‘h1’ tags of green color. 

            h1{
                color:rgba(11, 99, 150, 1);
            }
     -->

      <!-- HSL colors : Here ‘H’ stands for hue, ‘S’ for Saturation and ‘L’ for Lightness. HSL color values are specified as: 
    Syntax:  
          hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

        -->

        <div>
            HSL colors value:

            Hue is the color of the image itself. It’s range is from 0 to 360. 0 is for red, 120 is for green and 240 is for blue.
            Saturation is the intensity/purity of the hue. 0% is for a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. 
            When color is fully saturated, the color is considered in purest/truest version.
            Lightness is the color space’s brightness. 0% is for black, 100% is for white.
